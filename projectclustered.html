	<h3> CLUSTERED INDEPENDENCE </h3>
	<p> POST FORDIST CAPITALISM – Throughout the 20th century and exponentially increasing until today, Post Fordist capitalism has spurred economic inequality and advancement of disparity in the distribution of wealth that has provoked widespread poverty and lack of job security throughout the world. This imbalance has triggered an increase in marginalization of groups including the impoverished, mentally ill and previously incarcerated. Combined with Toronto’s growing population and the current intense housing bubble, a lack of housing security, access to affordable rent is leaving a huge population of people homeless, with unsafe housing and lack of necessary support particularly in urban areas.</p>

	<p> AIM – “Clustered Independence” is a residence providing a supportive, healthy environment for people in the struggle to regain control and independence in their lives and work towards self-sustainability. Although flexible, the building is designed to serve three marginalized and frequently discriminated groups in particular: previously homeless, incarcerated or institutionalized. A recent study in Toronto showed 22.9% of people were homeless before they were incarcerated and that of incarcerated people, 44.6% are at risk of homelessness when released, which exponentially increases their chance to reoffend. An estimate of 50% of homeless people have previously been institutionalized for severe mental illnesses including addictions. Many of these cases, even if they have accommodations to go back to after institutionalization or jail, it would be back to an unhealthy, unsupportive environment – including homelessness - that has a negative influence, encouraging the original lifestyle. In Ontario, landlords can legal discriminate against those with criminal records, some supportive housing screens and rejects those with records and many experience rejection from friends and family. As economic disparity grows, rejection from “the system” becomes more and more frequent, necessitating support like “Clustered Independence”. Supportive housing also has economic benefits for the city, costing merely $199.92 per month compared to $1,932 for a shelter bed, $4,333 for provincial jail and $10,900 for a hospital bed.
